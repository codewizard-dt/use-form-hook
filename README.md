## A `Form` component exposed by a hook

Hooking up forms in React can be a real pain in the butt, but this package makes it EASY. It automatically handles form data in a way that prevents unnecessary component re-renders and helps you write the LEAST CODE possible. This package also relies on Semantic UI.
